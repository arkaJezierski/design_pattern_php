# Design Patterns in PHP

This project demonstrates the implementation of common **Design Patterns** in PHP. The patterns are grouped into three main categories:

- **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Creational Patterns**
- **Structural Patterns**

Each pattern is organized into its own directory and includes:

- `index.php` — this is the starting point of an example implementation of the pattern. Some patterns include multiple example files.
- `README` — a brief description of the pattern and how it works
