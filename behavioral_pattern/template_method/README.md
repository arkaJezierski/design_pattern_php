# Template Method Design Pattern in PHP

This repository demonstrates the **Template Method** design pattern using a clear and practical example in PHP.

## ðŸ§  What is the Template Method Pattern?

The **Template Method Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines the **skeleton of an algorithm** in a base class, but lets subclasses redefine certain steps of that algorithm **without changing its overall structure**.

> In short: the base class controls the flow, while subclasses customize specific parts.

Itâ€™s useful when multiple classes share the same structure of an operation, but each step of the operation might differ slightly.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

interfaces
   ReportGenerator.php
src
   InventoryReport.php
   SalesReport.php
index.php

---

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

1. The abstract class `ReportGenerator` defines the general steps to create a report:
    - prepareData
    - generateHeader
    - generateBody (abstract)
    - generateFooter
    - export

2. Subclasses like `SalesReport` and `InventoryReport` implement their own version of `generateBody`, customizing whatâ€™s shown in the report content.

3. When `generate()` is called, it runs all the steps in order, using the custom logic where defined.

## âœ… Benefits of Template Method

- Reuses common logic across related classes.
- Keeps control flow in one place (base class).
- Enforces consistency across different implementations.
- Makes code easier to extend and maintain.

## ðŸ§ª Run the Example

1. Install dependencies (autoload):

```bash
composer dump-autoload
php index.php
