# Decorator Design Pattern in PHP

This project demonstrates the **Decorator** design pattern using a simple message formatting system in PHP.  
It shows how to dynamically add behavior (like logging, formatting, or encryption) to an object without modifying its class.

## ðŸ§  What is the Decorator Pattern?

The **Decorator Pattern** is a structural design pattern that lets you **wrap an object with additional behavior** â€” dynamically and transparently.

Itâ€™s useful when:
- You want to **add features step by step**
- You donâ€™t want to use inheritance for every combination
- You need to keep classes **open for extension but closed for modification**

> In short: decorators let you "stack" functionality without changing the original class.

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

We have:
- `PlainMessage` â€“ returns a simple string
- Decorators:
    - `LoggerDecorator` â€“ logs the message
    - `BoldDecorator` â€“ wraps message in `<b>` HTML tag
    - `EncryptedDecorator` â€“ encodes message using base64

You can chain them in any order.

## âœ… Why Use the Decorator Pattern?

- Makes functionality **modular and reusable**
- You can **combine decorators flexibly**
- Avoids deep inheritance trees
- Perfect for formatting, filtering, validation, logging, etc.
