# Proxy Design Pattern in PHP

This project demonstrates the **Proxy** design pattern using a simple file download example.  
It shows how to control access to a resource (like downloading a file) using a proxy.

## ðŸ§  What is the Proxy Pattern?

The **Proxy Pattern** is a structural design pattern that acts as a **substitute or placeholder** for another object.  
The proxy controls access to the real object and adds additional behavior like:

- Logging
- Access control
- Lazy loading
- Caching

> In short: the proxy controls access to another object â€” without changing the real object.

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

We have:
- `RealDownloader` â€“ the real service that downloads files
- `ProxyDownloader` â€“ checks user access before allowing download
- If the user has permission â†’ file is downloaded
- If not â†’ access is denied

## âœ… Why Use the Proxy Pattern?

- Adds logic **without modifying the real object**
- Helps with **security, performance, and control**
- Good for working with:
    - Protected resources
    - Heavy operations (e.g., big file loading)
    - External APIs
